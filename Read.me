# 🛡️ CyberSentinel – Cybersecurity Operations Dashboard  

**Developed by:** Ammar  
**Version:** 5.0  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
CyberSentinel is a **front-end simulation of a Security Operations Center (SOC)**. It provides an immersive, hacker-style interface designed for **educational and demonstration purposes**.  

The dashboard includes:  
- Real-time network diagnostics  
- Simulated threat intelligence logs  
- Interactive global maps with animated threat pings  

⚠️ **Note:** This tool is a simulation. While the IP scanner fetches real public network data, features like the *Insta Tracker* and *Threat Map* are purely **visual effects** to demonstrate how professional monitoring tools might look.

## 🛠 Features  
- **Real-Time IP Scanner** → Uses public APIs (`ipapi.co` / `ipify`) to display your current public IP, ISP, and approximate geolocation.  
- **Simulated Intrusion Detection** → Fictional logs of blocked login attempts and profile scans to illustrate monitoring concepts.  
- **Interactive Global Map** → Radar-style world map with animated “threat pings.”  
- **AI Security Assistant** → Built-in chat interface offering basic (simulated) security advice.  
- **Aesthetic Design** → Matrix-style digital rain, glitch typography, and dark terminal UI powered by **Tailwind CSS**.
